# What is BioNeMo?

BioNeMo is a software ecosystem produced by NVIDIA for the development and deployment of life sciences-oriented artificial intelligence models. BioNeMo provides a set of tools to help researchers build, train, and deploy AI models for various biological applications. The main components of BioNeMo are:

- **BioNeMo Framework**: a free-to-use collection of programming tools and packages offering access to optimized, pre-trained biomolecular models and workflows. The framework enables building and customizing models, including training and fine-tuning. Capabilities span various workloads and therapeutic modalities, such as molecular generation, protein structure prediction, protein-ligand, and representation learning.

- **BioNeMo NIMs**: easy-to-use, enterprise-ready _inference_ microservices with built-in API endpoints. NIMs are engineered for scalable, self- or cloud-hosted deployment of optimized, production-grade biomolecular foundation models. Check out the growing list of BioNeMo NIMs [here](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/biology).

When choosing between the BioNeMo Framework and BioNeMo NIMs, consider your project's specific requirements. The Framework is ideal for scenarios that require model training, fine-tuning, or customization, offering a comprehensive suite of tools and packages. In contrast, NIMs are optimized for inference-only workflows, providing easy-to-use, enterprise-ready microservices with built-in API endpoints. As a rule, use the Framework for custom model development or high-control modeling, and NIMs for inference against existing models.
