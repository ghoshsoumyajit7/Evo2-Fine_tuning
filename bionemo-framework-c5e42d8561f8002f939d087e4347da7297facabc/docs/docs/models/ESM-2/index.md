# ESM-2

## Model Overview

### Description

ESM-2 is a pre-trained, bi-directional encoder (BERT-style model) over amino acid sequences. ESM-2 models provide
embeddings for amino acids that have led to state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks such as structure and
function prediction. ESM-2 has been trained at a number of different model sizes. BioNeMo2 includes converted
checkpoints for the 650M and 3B parameter variants. The 650M model has 33 layers, 20 attention heads, and a hidden space
dimension of 1280. The 3B model has 36 layers, 40 attention heads, and a hidden space dimension of 2,560.

These models are ready for commercial use.

### Third-Party Community Consideration

This model is not owned or developed by NVIDIA. This model has been developed and built to a third-partyâ€™s requirements
for this application and use case [1]; see link to [Non-NVIDIA Model Card for ESM-2 3B model](

## Training & Evaluation

### Training Dataset

Original ESM-2 checkpoints from HuggingFace were trained with the UniProt 2021_04 sequence database. For more details on
the training dataset, see Lin *et al.* 2023. The train / test splits used by the original authors were not distributed.
A pre-training database compiled by NVIDIA following a similar approach is described in [UniProt
Dataset](../datasets/uniprot.md).

### Inference

## Competitive Benchmarking

### Accuracy

A validation set of 328,360 UniRef50 representative sequences were randomly selected from UniRef 2024_03 (see [UniProt
Dataset](../datasets/uniprot.md)). This validation set was used to ensure that the output of BioNeMo-converted
checkpoints is consistent with their outputs when evaluated with the HuggingFace Transformers library.

| Checkpoint | HuggingFace | BioNeMo2 | Lin *et al.* 2023                    |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------                |
| 650M       |  7.001      |  7.002   | 6.95 :material-information-outline:  |
| 3B         |  6.003      |  6.004   | 6.49 :material-information-outline:  |

!!! info "Different Validation Sets"

    The HuggingFace and converted BioNeMo2 checkpoints were evaluated on a newly curated validation set. Perplexities
    from Lin *et al.* 2023 are reported for comparison, but the original train/test splits are not available.

### Training Performance

#### Single-node Training Performance

![ESM-2 Single-Device Training Performance](../../assets/images/esm2/esm2_single_node_training_perf.png)

The pure-pytorch baseline (compiled with `torch.compile()`) raised an out-of-memory error for batch sizes larger than 16
at the ESM2-650M model size. The `bionemo2` model could handle batch sizes of 46, reaching a model flops utilization of
59.2% on an NVIDIA A100.

#### Model Scaling

![ESM-2 Model Scaling](../../assets/images/esm2/esm2_model_scaling.png)

Training ESM-2 at the 650M, 3B, and 15B model variants show improved performance with the BioNeMo2 framework over the
pure-pytorch baseline. These experiments were conducted on 16x NVIDIA A100 or 16x NVIDIA H100 GPUs split across two
nodes. <sup>*</sup>*Note:* 15B model variants were trained on 64 GPUs with the BioNeMo2 framework.

#### Device Scaling

![ESM-2 Device Scaling](../../assets/images/esm2/esm2_device_scaling.png)

Training ESM-3B on 256 NVIDIA A100s on 32 nodes achieved 96.85% of the theoretical linear throughput expected from
extrapolating single-node (8 GPU) performance, representing a model flops utilization of 60.6% at 256 devices.
