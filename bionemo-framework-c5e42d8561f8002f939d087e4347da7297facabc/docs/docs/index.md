**NVIDIA BioNeMo Framework** is a collection of programming tools, libraries, and models for computational drug
discovery. It accelerates the most time-consuming and costly stages of building and adapting biomolecular AI models by
providing domain-specific, optimized models and tooling that are easily integrated into GPU-based computational
resources for the fastest performance on the market. You can access BioNeMo Framework as a free community resource or
learn more about getting an enterprise license for improved expert-level support at the
[BioNeMo homepage](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/bionemo/).
